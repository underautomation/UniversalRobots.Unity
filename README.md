## 🎮 What This Unity Project Brings

This Unity package delivers:

🦾 **3D models of UR robot arms**  
- Imported from: [ros-industrial/universal_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot)  
- Uses widely accepted and community-validated **URDF definitions**  
- ⚠️ *Fully independent from ROS — we just borrow the 3D assets and definitions!*

🧠 **URDF loading made easy**  
- Uses this awesome URDF loader: [gkjohnson/urdf-loaders](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders)  
- Supports **DAE files** natively in Unity Editor

🧩 **Ready-to-go demo scene**  
- Instantiates **all UR robot models** (UR3, UR5, UR10, UR16, UR20, UR30)  
- Connects to **real robots** via `UnderAutomation.UniversalRobots.dll`  
- Shows **real-time joint updates** from the live robot
